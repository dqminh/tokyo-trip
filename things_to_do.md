# Day & Afternoon
Visit the Meiji-jingu shrine in Yoyogi. Keep in mind that they close the park
at sunset.

See the Senso-ji temple and the surrounding area. If you feel like it, walk a
couple of blocks to the west and get yourself a ceramic knife at
Kappabashi-dori, the hub of Tokyo food industry.

Take the automatic Yurikamome line from Shiodome to Odaiba. Enjoy the views.
At Odaiba, get on a cruise boat to Asakusa.


Visit the Tsukiji market early in the morning. Try to make your way to the tuna
auction. Have breakfast at one of the sushi shops at the market.
As an alternative, run around the Imperial palace grounds with the rest of the
crowd.

Eat like a sumo wrestler. Choose a restaurant in the Ryoogoku neighborhood in
Sumida and enjoy a hearty meal!
Eat Monjayaki (best in Tsukishima district) or Okonomiyaki, a Japanese style
omelette. The omelette is fried at your table, transforming it in a social
experience. Put some fish "chips" on it and the fish will dance for you. Enjoy
a Japanese beer, served in an iced glass.

Study modern architecture at Omotesando: it has buildings by SANAA, Tadao Ando,
      MVRDV, Herzog & de Meuron, Kisho Kurokawa, Jun Aoki and others.

      Buy a bucketful of Daruma dolls at the Oriental Bazaar and have a tonkatsu at the Maisen.

      Take a walk in the Shinjuku Gyoen, the best park in downtown Tokyo.
      Or go to Ueno, also a good park, and visit the fantastic Gallery of Horyu-ji treasures.

# Late afternoon
      Go to the Mori art museum in the evening to see the sunset. Or go to the
      top of the Metropolitan Government Building in Nishi Shinjuku which is free of
      charge. In autumn, the sun sets behind mount Fuji...
      to the National Art Museum in Tokyo. Mind blowing exhibitions in great
      architecture.

      At dusk, go to the Mori Museum at the top of the Mori tower in Roppongi. See
      the night falling on Tokyo from the helipad. You'll have to get an extra
      ticket, but it's worth it.


      Go to an Onsen, a Japanese hot tube. There is one in every neighborhood.

# Night
      Go to Shinjuku Golden Gai, a small neighborhood with hundreds of tiny bars.
      Really tidy bars, sometimes only 8 people fit in them! Great opportunity to
      talk to Japanese people, to sing karaoke and to meet all kind of interesting
      people. We celebrated new year's eve in such a bar, ate long noodles for a long
      life and met a shy porn director...

      Get lost in the teen neon jungle of Shibuya.

      Spend the evening in Kagurazaka, the old geisha district to the east of
      Shinjuku. Try the Japanese take on the french food there.

      Late at night, go to the Golden Gai area in Shinjuku and try to find La jet√©e,
      a favorite bar of Chris Marker and Wim Wenders.
